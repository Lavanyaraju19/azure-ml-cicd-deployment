AI Deployment Simulation - Freelance DevOps Engineer
Project Overview
This repository contains code and configurations used for simulating AI deployments on Azure Cloud. The solution focuses on automating infrastructure provisioning, continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), and real-time observability for AI models deployed using Azure services.

Key Technologies
Azure App Services

Azure Functions

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Terraform for Infrastructure Automation

CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps)

Secret Management with Azure Key Vault

Observability using Azure Monitor

Responsibilities
Infrastructure as Code: Used Terraform to define and provision Azure resources.

CI/CD Pipeline Management: Automated the full deployment cycle with GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps.

Secret Management: Integrated Azure Key Vault for secure handling of credentials.

Monitoring and Observability: Set up Azure Monitor to track performance and errors in real-time.

Prerequisites
Before using this action, ensure the following:

An Azure Machine Learning workspace is set up and accessible.

The model is registered within your AML workspace.

Optional: An AKS cluster is available for model deployment, though ACI is sufficient for simpler setups.

How to Use

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ai-deployment-simulation.git

Configure your Azure credentials and initialize Terraform:

terraform init

Apply the infrastructure:
terraform apply

Use the CI/CD pipelines for continuous deployment.

Conclusion
This project showcases how AI deployments can be efficiently simulated and automated using Azure Cloud and DevOps practices. For detailed information about setup and configurations, please refer to the specific scripts and workflows in the repository.

Dependencies
Checkout: Checkout your repository contents.

aml-workspace: Set up or use an existing Azure Machine Learning workspace.

aml-registermodel: Register models in Azure.

aml-compute: Manage AKS clusters if deploying to AKS.


Post-Deployment Testing
To validate the model after deployment, provide a test script located at code/test/test.py (or customize the path). 
This script will automatically run after the model is deployed, ensuring that the endpoint is functional.


Resources
Getting Started Template: Set up a simple ML Ops process.

Advanced Template: For enterprise-level ML Ops processes.
